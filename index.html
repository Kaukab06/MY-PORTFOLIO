    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in <strong>Computer Science and Data Analytics</strong> at <strong>IIT Patna</strong>.
      As a first-year student, I'm exploring various areas in technology to find where my passion lies. Currently, I'm highly interested in
      <strong>Web Development</strong>, <strong>Data Science</strong>, and <strong>Generative AI</strong>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I’ve studied key mathematical foundations such as <strong>Linear Algebra</strong> and <strong>Numerical Methods</strong> for Data Science,
      which help me understand how algorithms work and models work, particularly in <strong>Machine Learning</strong>.
      I'm also building my programming skills and learning computer science fundamentals.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Technologies I’m currently learning and working with include:
      <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>DBMS</strong>,
      <strong>Python</strong>, and I’m learning <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong> (DSA) in Python.
    </p>
     <p>Special thanks to various resources, including assistance from AI systems, for guidance on CSS styling and design principles while building this portfolio.</p>
