# Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website, where I showcase the projects and technologies I'm currently working on. It's built using basic HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I am a first-year student at IIT Patna, currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in **Computer Science and Data Analytics**.

## About Me

I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in **Computer Science and Data Analytics** at IIT Patna. As a first-year student, I'm exploring various areas in technology to find where my passion lies. Currently, I'm highly interested in Web Development, Data Science, and Generative AI.

I’ve studied key mathematical foundations such as **Linear Algebra** and **Numerical Methods for Data Science**, which help me understand how algorithms and models work, particularly in **Machine Learning**. I'm also building my programming skills and learning computer science fundamentals.

Technologies I’m currently learning and working with include: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Bootstrap**, **DBMS**, **Python**, and I’m learning **Data Structures and Algorithms** (DSA) in Python.

Special thanks to various resources, including assistance from AI systems, for guidance on CSS styling and design principles while building this portfolio.

## Projects

### Hostel Website (Ongoing)
This is my academic capstone project, done as a team of 5 members. We're building a website for a PG (Paying Guest) hostel. The website aims to improve the living experience for students by offering an easy-to-use platform for hostel management.

### Web Development Pages (Coming Soon)
I'm currently working on building interactive web pages. Stay tuned for more updates on my projects!

### Basic AI Project with Sora (Image Attachment) - In Progress
As part of my learning process, I experimented with Sora, where I attached images to generate AI-based outputs. This helped me understand the potential of combining image data with AI models. This project is currently in progress.
